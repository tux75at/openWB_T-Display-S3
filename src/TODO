Whats working:
- Connection with WiFi network
- receiving MQTT values (based on previous project openWB_OLEDDisplay)
- Display Values for EVU, PV, LP1 charging and SOC, Plugstatus is not shown at the moment
- Display is with a basic layout, only one default font size is used
- Font size can be changed

What needs to be done:
- add Plugstatus on Display
- Animated GIFs for Layout need to be created
- Layout needs to be done
- Animated GIF with openWB logo at start?
